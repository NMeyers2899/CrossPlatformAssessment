# Introduction
Survive the Day is a small game where the player is set against an endless horde of enemies constantly attempting to reach them to decrease their health and eventually destroy them. The player has a projectile they can fire by using the left mouse button which will fire in the direction the mouse is pointing to. Enemy's health will increase over time, so to keep up with it the player can increase their stats. One button increases the damage the player can deal with their projectiles and another increases their health by one point. Manage the money you have to upgrade what you can while killing the enemies on their way to you to stay alive!
